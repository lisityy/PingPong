<span dir="ltr">hand switch. At difficulty level "EASY" the size of the ball is greatest and the speed of the ball the lowest,</span>\

<span dir="ltr">the size of the ball decreases, and effects are also added:</span>

1. <span dir="ltr">Lightning, which speeds up the ball.</span>
2. <span dir="ltr">Snowflake, which slows down the ball.</span>
3. <span dir="ltr">2X, which doubles the size of the ball.</span>
